/**
 * A channel that can be multiplexed via a {@link Selector}.
 *
 * <p> In order to be used with a selector, an instance of this class must
 * first be <i>registered</i> via the {@link #register(Selector,int,Object)
 * register} method.  This method returns a new {@link SelectionKey} object
 * that represents the channel's registration with the selector.
 *
 * <p> Once registered with a selector, a channel remains registered until it
 * is <i>deregistered</i>.  This involves deallocating whatever resources were
 * allocated to the channel by the selector.
 *
 * <p> A channel cannot be deregistered directly; instead, the key representing
 * its registration must be <i>cancelled</i>.  Cancelling a key requests that
 * the channel be deregistered during the selector's next selection operation.
 * A key may be cancelled explicitly by invoking its {@link
 * SelectionKey#cancel() cancel} method.  All of a channel's keys are cancelled
 * implicitly when the channel is closed, whether by invoking its {@link
 * Channel#close close} method or by interrupting a thread blocked in an I/O
 * operation upon the channel.
 *
 * <p> If the selector itself is closed then the channel will be deregistered,
 * and the key representing its registration will be invalidated, without
 * further delay.
 *
 * <p> A channel may be registered at most once with any particular selector.
 *
 * <p> Whether or not a channel is registered with one or more selectors may be
 * determined by invoking the {@link #isRegistered isRegistered} method.
 *
 * <p> Selectable channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent
 * threads. </p>
 *
 *
 * <a name="bm">
 * <h4>Blocking mode</h4>
 *
 * A selectable channel is either in <i>blocking</i> mode or in
 * <i>non-blocking</i> mode.  In blocking mode, every I/O operation invoked
 * upon the channel will block until it completes.  In non-blocking mode an I/O
 * operation will never block and may transfer fewer bytes than were requested
 * or possibly no bytes at all.  The blocking mode of a selectable channel may
 * be determined by invoking its {@link #isBlocking isBlocking} method.
 *
 * <p> Newly-created selectable channels are always in blocking mode.
 * Non-blocking mode is most useful in conjunction with selector-based
 * multiplexing.  A channel must be placed into non-blocking mode before being
 * registered with a selector, and may not be returned to blocking mode until
 * it has been deregistered.
