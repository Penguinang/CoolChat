 * A token representing the membership of an Internet Protocol (IP) multicast

 *
 * <p> A membership key may represent a membership to receive all datagrams sent
 * to the group, or it may be <em>source-specific</em>, meaning that it
 * represents a membership that receives only datagrams from a specific source
 * address. Whether or not a membership key is source-specific may be determined
 * by invoking its {@link #sourceAddress() sourceAddress} method.
 *
 * <p> A membership key is valid upon creation and remains valid until the
 * membership is dropped by invoking the {@link #drop() drop} method, or
 * the channel is closed. The validity of the membership key may be tested
 * by invoking its {@link #isValid() isValid} method.
 *
 * <p> Where a membership key is not source-specific and the underlying operation
 * system supports source filtering, then the {@link #block block} and {@link
 * #unblock unblock} methods can be used to block or unblock multicast datagrams
 * from particular source addresses.
