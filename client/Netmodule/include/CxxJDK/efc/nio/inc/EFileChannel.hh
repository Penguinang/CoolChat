/**
 * A channel for reading, writing, mapping, and manipulating a file.
 *
 * <p> A file channel has a current <i>position</i> within its file which can
 * be both {@link #position() </code>queried<code>} and {@link #position(long)
 * </code>modified<code>}.  The file itself contains a variable-length sequence
 * of bytes that can be read and written and whose current {@link #size
 * </code><i>size</i><code>} can be queried.  The size of the file increases
 * when bytes are written beyond its current size; the size of the file
 * decreases when it is {@link #truncate </code><i>truncated</i><code>}.  The
 * file may also have some associated <i>metadata</i> such as access
 * permissions, content type, and last-modification time; this class does not
 * define methods for metadata access.
 *
 * <p> In addition to the familiar read, write, and close operations of byte
 * channels, this class defines the following file-specific operations: </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *   <li><p> Bytes may be {@link #read(ByteBuffer, long) </code>read<code>} or
 *   {@link #write(ByteBuffer, long) </code>written<code>} at an absolute
 *   position in a file in a way that does not affect the channel's current
 *   position.  </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> A region of a file may be {@link #map </code>mapped<code>}
 *   directly into memory; for large files this is often much more efficient
 *   than invoking the usual <tt>read</tt> or <tt>write</tt> methods.
 *   </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> Updates made to a file may be {@link #force </code>forced
 *   out<code>} to the underlying storage device, ensuring that data are not
 *   lost in the event of a system crash.  </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> Bytes can be transferred from a file {@link #transferTo </code>to
 *   some other channel<code>}, and {@link #transferFrom </code>vice
 *   versa<code>}, in a way that can be optimized by many operating systems
 *   into a very fast transfer directly to or from the filesystem cache.
 *   </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> A region of a file may be {@link FileLock </code>locked<code>}
 *   against access by other programs.  </p></li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> File channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  The
 * {@link Channel#close close} method may be invoked at any time, as specified
 * by the {@link Channel} interface.  Only one operation that involves the
 * channel's position or can change its file's size may be in progress at any
 * given time; attempts to initiate a second such operation while the first is
 * still in progress will block until the first operation completes.  Other
 * operations, in particular those that take an explicit position, may proceed
 * concurrently; whether they in fact do so is dependent upon the underlying
 * implementation and is therefore unspecified.
 *
 * <p> The view of a file provided by an instance of this class is guaranteed
 * to be consistent with other views of the same file provided by other
 * instances in the same program.  The view provided by an instance of this
 * class may or may not, however, be consistent with the views seen by other
 * concurrently-running programs due to caching performed by the underlying
 * operating system and delays induced by network-filesystem protocols.  This
 * is true regardless of the language in which these other programs are
 * written, and whether they are running on the same machine or on some other
 * machine.  The exact nature of any such inconsistencies are system-dependent
 * and are therefore unspecified.
 *
 * <p> This class does not define methods for opening existing files or for
 * creating new ones; such methods may be added in a future release.  In this
 * release a file channel can be obtained from an existing {@link
 * java.io.FileInputStream#getChannel FileInputStream}, {@link
 * java.io.FileOutputStream#getChannel FileOutputStream}, or {@link
 * java.io.RandomAccessFile#getChannel RandomAccessFile} object by invoking
 * that object's <tt>getChannel</tt> method, which returns a file channel that
 * is connected to the same underlying file.
 *
 * <p> The state of a file channel is intimately connected to that of the
 * object whose <tt>getChannel</tt> method returned the channel.  Changing the
 * channel's position, whether explicitly or by reading or writing bytes, will
 * change the file position of the originating object, and vice versa.
 * Changing the file's length via the file channel will change the length seen
 * via the originating object, and vice versa.  Changing the file's content by
 * writing bytes will change the content seen by the originating object, and
 * vice versa.
 *
 * <a name="open-mode"><p> At various points this class specifies that an
 * instance that is "open for reading," "open for writing," or "open for
 * reading and writing" is required.  A channel obtained via the {@link
 * java.io.FileInputStream#getChannel getChannel} method of a {@link
 * java.io.FileInputStream} instance will be open for reading.  A channel
 * obtained via the {@link java.io.FileOutputStream#getChannel getChannel}
 * method of a {@link java.io.FileOutputStream} instance will be open for
 * writing.  Finally, a channel obtained via the {@link
 * java.io.RandomAccessFile#getChannel getChannel} method of a {@link
 * java.io.RandomAccessFile} instance will be open for reading if the instance
 * was created with mode <tt>"r"</tt> and will be open for reading and writing
 * if the instance was created with mode <tt>"rw"</tt>.
 *
 * <a name="append-mode"><p> A file channel that is open for writing may be in
 * <i>append mode</i>, for example if it was obtained from a file-output stream
 * that was created by invoking the {@link
 * java.io.FileOutputStream#FileOutputStream(java.io.File,boolean)
 * FileOutputStream(File,boolean)} constructor and passing <tt>true</tt> for
 * the second parameter.  In this mode each invocation of a relative write
 * operation first advances the position to the end of the file and then writes
 * the requested data.  Whether the advancement of the position and the writing
 * of the data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
 * therefore unspecified.
