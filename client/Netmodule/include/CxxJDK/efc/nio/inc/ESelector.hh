/**
 * A multiplexor of {@link SelectableChannel} objects.
 *
 * <p> A selector may be created by invoking the {@link #open open} method of
 * this class, which will use the system's default {@link
 * java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider </code>selector provider<code>} to
 * create a new selector.  A selector may also be created by invoking the
 * {@link java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider#openSelector openSelector}
 * method of a custom selector provider.  A selector remains open until it is
 * closed via its {@link #close close} method.
 *
 * <a name="ks">
 *
 * <p> A selectable channel's registration with a selector is represented by a
 * {@link SelectionKey} object.  A selector maintains three sets of selection
 * keys:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *   <li><p> The <i>key set</i> contains the keys representing the current
 *   channel registrations of this selector.  This set is returned by the
 *   {@link #keys() keys} method. </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> The <i>selected-key set</i> is the set of keys such that each
 *   key's channel was detected to be ready for at least one of the operations
 *   identified in the key's interest set during a prior selection operation.
 *   This set is returned by the {@link #selectedKeys() selectedKeys} method.
 *   The selected-key set is always a subset of the key set. </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> The <i>cancelled-key</i> set is the set of keys that have been
 *   cancelled but whose channels have not yet been deregistered.  This set is
 *   not directly accessible.  The cancelled-key set is always a subset of the
 *   key set. </p></li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> All three sets are empty in a newly-created selector.
 *
 * <p> A key is added to a selector's key set as a side effect of registering a
 * channel via the channel's {@link SelectableChannel#register(Selector,int)
 * register} method.  Cancelled keys are removed from the key set during
 * selection operations.  The key set itself is not directly modifiable.
 *
 * <p> A key is added to its selector's cancelled-key set when it is cancelled,
 * whether by closing its channel or by invoking its {@link SelectionKey#cancel
 * cancel} method.  Cancelling a key will cause its channel to be deregistered
 * during the next selection operation, at which time the key will removed from
 * all of the selector's key sets.
 *
 * <a name="sks"><p> Keys are added to the selected-key set by selection
 * operations.  A key may be removed directly from the selected-key set by
 * invoking the set's {@link java.util.Set#remove(java.lang.Object) remove}
 * method or by invoking the {@link java.util.Iterator#remove() remove} method
 * of an {@link java.util.Iterator </code>iterator<code>} obtained from the
 * set.  Keys are never removed from the selected-key set in any other way;
 * they are not, in particular, removed as a side effect of selection
 * operations.  Keys may not be added directly to the selected-key set. </p>
 *
 *
 * <a name="selop">
 * <h4>Selection</h4>
 *
 * <p> During each selection operation, keys may be added to and removed from a
 * selector's selected-key set and may be removed from its key and
 * cancelled-key sets.  Selection is performed by the {@link #select()}, {@link
 * #select(long)}, and {@link #selectNow()} methods, and involves three steps:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 *   <li><p> Each key in the cancelled-key set is removed from each key set of
 *   which it is a member, and its channel is deregistered.  This step leaves
 *   the cancelled-key set empty. </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
 *   readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
 *   identified by its key's interest set as of the moment that the selection
 *   operation began.  For a channel that is ready for at least one such
 *   operation, one of the following two actions is performed: </p>
 *
 *   <ol type=a>
 *
 *     <li><p> If the channel's key is not already in the selected-key set then
 *     it is added to that set and its ready-operation set is modified to
 *     identify exactly those operations for which the channel is now reported
 *     to be ready.  Any readiness information previously recorded in the ready
 *     set is discarded.  </p></li>
 *
 *     <li><p> Otherwise the channel's key is already in the selected-key set,
 *     so its ready-operation set is modified to identify any new operations
 *     for which the channel is reported to be ready.  Any readiness
 *     information previously recorded in the ready set is preserved; in other
 *     words, the ready set returned by the underlying system is
 *     bitwise-disjoined into the key's current ready set. </p></li>
 *
 *   </ol></li>
 *
 *   If all of the keys in the key set at the start of this step have empty
 *   interest sets then neither the selected-key set nor any of the keys'
 *   ready-operation sets will be updated.
 *
 *   <li><p> If any keys were added to the cancelled-key set while step (2) was
 *   in progress then they are processed as in step (1). </p></li>
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p> Whether or not a selection operation blocks to wait for one or more
 * channels to become ready, and if so for how long, is the only essential
 * difference between the three selection methods. </p>
 *
 *
 * <h4>Concurrency</h4>
 *
 * <p> Selectors are themselves safe for use by multiple concurrent threads;
 * their key sets, however, are not.
 *
 * <p> The selection operations synchronize on the selector itself, on the key
 * set, and on the selected-key set, in that order.  They also synchronize on
 * the cancelled-key set during steps (1) and (3) above.
 *
 * <p> Changes made to the interest sets of a selector's keys while a
 * selection operation is in progress have no effect upon that operation; they
 * will be seen by the next selection operation.
 *
 * <p> Keys may be cancelled and channels may be closed at any time.  Hence the
 * presence of a key in one or more of a selector's key sets does not imply
 * that the key is valid or that its channel is open.  Application code should
 * be careful to synchronize and check these conditions as necessary if there
 * is any possibility that another thread will cancel a key or close a channel.
 *
 * <p> A thread blocked in one of the {@link #select()} or {@link
 * #select(long)} methods may be interrupted by some other thread in one of
 * three ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *   <li><p> By invoking the selector's {@link #wakeup wakeup} method,
 *   </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> By invoking the selector's {@link #close close} method, or
 *   </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> By invoking the blocked thread's {@link
 *   java.lang.Thread#interrupt() interrupt} method, in which case its
 *   interrupt status will be set and the selector's {@link #wakeup wakeup}
 *   method will be invoked. </p></li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> The {@link #close close} method synchronizes on the selector and all
 * three key sets in the same order as in a selection operation.
 *
 * <a name="ksc">
 *
 * <p> A selector's key and selected-key sets are not, in general, safe for use
 * by multiple concurrent threads.  If such a thread might modify one of these
 * sets directly then access should be controlled by synchronizing on the set
 * itself.  The iterators returned by these sets' {@link
 * java.util.Set#iterator() iterator} methods are <i>fail-fast:</i> If the set
 * is modified after the iterator is created, in any way except by invoking the
 * iterator's own {@link java.util.Iterator#remove() remove} method, then a
 * {@link java.util.ConcurrentModificationException} will be thrown. </p>

/**
 * Base implementation class for selectors.
 *
 * <p> This class encapsulates the low-level machinery required to implement
 * the interruption of selection operations.  A concrete selector class must
 * invoke the {@link #begin begin} and {@link #end end} methods before and
 * after, respectively, invoking an I/O operation that might block
 * indefinitely.  In order to ensure that the {@link #end end} method is always
 * invoked, these methods should be used within a
 * <tt>try</tt>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<tt>finally</tt> block:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * try {
 *     begin();
 *     // Perform blocking I/O operation here
 *     ...
 * } finally {
 *     end();
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p> This class also defines methods for maintaining a selector's
 * cancelled-key set and for removing a key from its channel's key set, and
 * declares the abstract {@link #register register} method that is invoked by a
 * selectable channel's {@link AbstractSelectableChannel#register register}
 * method in order to perform the actual work of registering a channel.  </p>
