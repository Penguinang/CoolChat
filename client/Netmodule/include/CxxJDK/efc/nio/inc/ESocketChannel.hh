/**
 * A selectable channel for stream-oriented connecting sockets.
 *
 * <p> A socket channel is created by invoking one of the {@link #open open}
 * methods of this class.  It is not possible to create a channel for an arbitrary,
 * pre-existing socket. A newly-created socket channel is open but not yet
 * connected.  An attempt to invoke an I/O operation upon an unconnected
 * channel will cause a {@link NotYetConnectedException} to be thrown.  A
 * socket channel can be connected by invoking its {@link #connect connect}
 * method; once connected, a socket channel remains connected until it is
 * closed.  Whether or not a socket channel is connected may be determined by
 * invoking its {@link #isConnected isConnected} method.
 *
 * <p> Socket channels support <i>non-blocking connection:</i>&nbsp;A socket
 * channel may be created and the process of establishing the link to the
 * remote socket may be initiated via the {@link #connect connect} method for
 * later completion by the {@link #finishConnect finishConnect} method.
 * Whether or not a connection operation is in progress may be determined by
 * invoking the {@link #isConnectionPending isConnectionPending} method.
 *
 * <p> Socket channels support <i>asynchronous shutdown,</i> which is similar
 * to the asynchronous close operation specified in the {@link Channel} class.
 * If the input side of a socket is shut down by one thread while another
 * thread is blocked in a read operation on the socket's channel, then the read
 * operation in the blocked thread will complete without reading any bytes and
 * will return <tt>-1</tt>.  If the output side of a socket is shut down by one
 * thread while another thread is blocked in a write operation on the socket's
 * channel, then the blocked thread will receive an {@link
 * AsynchronousCloseException}.
 *
 * <p> Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
 * setOption} method. Socket channels support the following options:
 * <blockquote>
 * <table border summary="Socket options">
 *   <tr>
 *     <th>Option Name</th>
 *     <th>Description</th>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_SNDBUF SO_SNDBUF} </td>
 *     <td> The size of the socket send buffer </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} </td>
 *     <td> The size of the socket receive buffer </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_KEEPALIVE SO_KEEPALIVE} </td>
 *     <td> Keep connection alive </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} </td>
 *     <td> Re-use address </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_LINGER SO_LINGER} </td>
 *     <td> Linger on close if data is present (when configured in blocking mode
 *          only) </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#TCP_NODELAY TCP_NODELAY} </td>
 *     <td> Disable the Nagle algorithm </td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 * </blockquote>
 * Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.
 *
 * <p> Socket channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  They
 * support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one thread may be
 * reading and at most one thread may be writing at any given time.  The {@link
 * #connect connect} and {@link #finishConnect finishConnect} methods are
 * mutually synchronized against each other, and an attempt to initiate a read
 * or write operation while an invocation of one of these methods is in
 * progress will block until that invocation is complete.  </p>
