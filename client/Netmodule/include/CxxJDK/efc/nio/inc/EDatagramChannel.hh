/**
 * A selectable channel for datagram-oriented sockets.
 *
 * <p> A datagram channel is created by invoking one of the {@link #open open} methods
 * of this class. It is not possible to create a channel for an arbitrary,
 * pre-existing datagram socket. A newly-created datagram channel is open but not
 * connected. A datagram channel need not be connected in order for the {@link #send
 * send} and {@link #receive receive} methods to be used.  A datagram channel may be
 * connected, by invoking its {@link #connect connect} method, in order to
 * avoid the overhead of the security checks are otherwise performed as part of
 * every send and receive operation.  A datagram channel must be connected in
 * order to use the {@link #read(java.nio.ByteBuffer) read} and {@link
 * #write(java.nio.ByteBuffer) write} methods, since those methods do not
 * accept or return socket addresses.
 *
 * <p> Once connected, a datagram channel remains connected until it is
 * disconnected or closed.  Whether or not a datagram channel is connected may
 * be determined by invoking its {@link #isConnected isConnected} method.
 *
 * <p> Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
 * setOption} method. A datagram channel to an Internet Protocol socket supports
 * the following options:
 * <blockquote>
 * <table border summary="Socket options">
 *   <tr>
 *     <th>Option Name</th>
 *     <th>Description</th>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_SNDBUF SO_SNDBUF} </td>
 *     <td> The size of the socket send buffer </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} </td>
 *     <td> The size of the socket receive buffer </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} </td>
 *     <td> Re-use address </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_BROADCAST SO_BROADCAST} </td>
 *     <td> Allow transmission of broadcast datagrams </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#IP_TOS IP_TOS} </td>
 *     <td> The Type of Service (ToS) octet in the Internet Protocol (IP) header </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#IP_MULTICAST_IF IP_MULTICAST_IF} </td>
 *     <td> The network interface for Internet Protocol (IP) multicast datagrams </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#IP_MULTICAST_TTL
 *       IP_MULTICAST_TTL} </td>
 *     <td> The <em>time-to-live</em> for Internet Protocol (IP) multicast
 *       datagrams </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#IP_MULTICAST_LOOP
 *       IP_MULTICAST_LOOP} </td>
 *     <td> Loopback for Internet Protocol (IP) multicast datagrams </td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 * </blockquote>
 * Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.
 *
 * <p> Datagram channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  They
 * support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one thread may be
 * reading and at most one thread may be writing at any given time.  </p>
