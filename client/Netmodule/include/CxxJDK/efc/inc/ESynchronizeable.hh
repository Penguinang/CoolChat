/**
 * @brief Classes derived from \c Object and \c Synchronizeable have a
 * mutex like all Java objects do.
 *
 * I.e. one can protect critical sections of code by synchronizing on
 * such an object (see the \c synchronized keyword in Java).
 * The \c SYNCHRONIZED(obj) macro provides a shortcut to
 * synchronize on the object \c obj (see example below).
 *
 * Note that the \c Synchronizeable 'interface' does not support
 * \c wait() and \c notify(). Hopefully \c Monitorable will do so in the
 * future :-)
 *
 * \b Example:
 *
 * You need an object to synchronize on that is derived from
 * \c Synchronizeable:
 * \code
 *  class Sync : public Object, public Synchronizeable {
 *   public:
 *    Sync() {};
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * You need an instance of the new \c Sync class:
 * <code><pre> Sync *sync = new Sync();</pre></code>
 *
 * Now you can synchronize blocks of code on this new synchronizeable
 * object \c sync:
 * \code
 * // some code
 * ...
 * {
 *   SYNCHRONIZED(sync) {
 *   ...
 *   // inside synchronized block!
 *   ...
 *  }}
 * \endcode
 *
 * The same code written in Java:
 * \code
 * Object sync = new Object();
 *
 * // some code
 * ...
 * synchronized(sync) {
 *   ...
 *   // inside synchronized block!
 *   ...
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * @class Synchronizeable

	/**
	 * Causes the current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the

	 * specified amount of time has elapsed.
	 * <p>
	 * The current thread must own this object's monitor.
	 * <p>
	 * This method causes the current thread (call it <var>T</var>) to
	 * place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish
	 * any and all synchronization claims on this object. Thread <var>T</var>
	 * becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant
	 * until one of four things happens:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Some other thread invokes the <tt>notify</tt> method for this
	 * object and thread <var>T</var> happens to be arbitrarily chosen as
	 * the thread to be awakened.
	 * <li>Some other thread invokes the <tt>notifyAll</tt> method for this
	 * object.
	 * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt() interrupts}
	 * thread <var>T</var>.
	 * <li>The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less.  If
	 * <tt>timeout</tt> is zero, however, then real time is not taken into
	 * consideration and the thread simply waits until notified.
	 * </ul>
	 * The thread <var>T</var> is then removed from the wait set for this
	 * object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It then competes in the
	 * usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the
	 * object; once it has gained control of the object, all its
	 * synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo
	 * ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the <tt>wait</tt>
	 * method was invoked. Thread <var>T</var> then returns from the
	 * invocation of the <tt>wait</tt> method. Thus, on return from the
	 * <tt>wait</tt> method, the synchronization state of the object and of
	 * thread <tt>T</tt> is exactly as it was when the <tt>wait</tt> method
	 * was invoked.
	 * <p>
	 * A thread can also wake up without being notified, interrupted, or
	 * timing out, a so-called <i>spurious wakeup</i>.  While this will rarely
	 * occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for
	 * the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and
	 * continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied.  In other words,
	 * waits should always occur in loops, like this one:
	 * <pre>
	 *     synchronized (obj) {
	 *         while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt;)
	 *             obj.wait(timeout);
	 *         ... // Perform action appropriate to condition
	 *     }
	 * </pre>
	 * (For more information on this topic, see Section 3.2.3 in Doug Lea's
	 * "Concurrent Programming in Java (Second Edition)" (Addison-Wesley,
	 * 2000), or Item 50 in Joshua Bloch's "Effective Java Programming
	 * Language Guide" (Addison-Wesley, 2001).
	 *
	 * <p>If the current thread is {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#interrupt()
	 * interrupted} by any thread before or while it is waiting, then an

	 * thrown until the lock status of this object has been restored as
	 * described above.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Note that the <tt>wait</tt> method, as it places the current thread
	 * into the wait set for this object, unlocks only this object; any
