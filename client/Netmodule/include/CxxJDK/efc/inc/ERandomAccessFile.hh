/**
 * Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a 
 * random access file. A random access file behaves like a large 
 * array of bytes stored in the file system. There is a kind of cursor, 
 * or index into the implied array, called the <em>file pointer</em>; 
 * input operations read bytes starting at the file pointer and advance 
 * the file pointer past the bytes read. If the random access file is 
 * created in read/write mode, then output operations are also available; 
 * output operations write bytes starting at the file pointer and advance 
 * the file pointer past the bytes written. Output operations that write 
 * past the current end of the implied array cause the array to be 
 * extended. The file pointer can be read by the 
 * <code>getFilePointer</code> method and set by the <code>seek</code> 
 * method. 
 * <p>
 * It is generally true of all the reading routines in this class that 
 * if end-of-file is reached before the desired number of bytes has been 
 * read, an <code>EOFException</code> (which is a kind of 
 * <code>IOException</code>) is thrown. If any byte cannot be read for 
 * any reason other than end-of-file, an <code>IOException</code> other 
 * than <code>EOFException</code> is thrown. In particular, an 
 * <code>IOException</code> may be thrown if the stream has been closed.
