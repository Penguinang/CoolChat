/**
 * The root interface in the <i>collection hierarchy</i>.  A collection
 * represents a group of objects, known as its <i>elements</i>.  Some
 * collections allow duplicate elements and others do not.  Some are ordered
 * and others unordered.  The JDK does not provide any <i>direct</i>
 * implementations of this interface: it provides implementations of more
 * specific subinterfaces like <tt>Set</tt> and <tt>List</tt>.  This interface
 * is typically used to pass collections around and manipulate them where
 * maximum generality is desired.
 *
 * <p><i>Bags</i> or <i>multisets</i> (unordered collections that may contain
 * duplicate elements) should implement this interface directly.
 *
 * <p>All general-purpose <tt>Collection</tt> implementation classes (which
 * typically implement <tt>Collection</tt> indirectly through one of its
 * subinterfaces) should provide two "standard" constructors: a void (no
 * arguments) constructor, which creates an empty collection, and a
 * constructor with a single argument of type <tt>Collection</tt>, which
 * creates a new collection with the same elements as its argument.  In
 * effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any collection,
 * producing an equivalent collection of the desired implementation type.
 * There is no way to enforce this convention (as interfaces cannot contain
 * constructors) but all of the general-purpose <tt>Collection</tt>
 * implementations in the Java platform libraries comply.
 *
 * <p>The "destructive" methods contained in this interface, that is, the
 * methods that modify the collection on which they operate, are specified to
 * throw <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if this collection does not
 * support the operation.  If this is the case, these methods may, but are not
 * required to, throw an <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if the
 * invocation would have no effect on the collection.  For example, invoking
 * the {@link #addAll(Collection)} method on an unmodifiable collection may,
 * but is not required to, throw the exception if the collection to be added
 * is empty.
 *
 * <p>Some collection implementations have restrictions on the elements that
 * they may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
 * and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
 * add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * <tt>NullPointerException</tt> or <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.  Attempting
 * to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
 * or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
 * behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
 * operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
 * the insertion of an ineligible element into the collection may throw an
 * exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>It is up to each collection to determine its own synchronization
 * policy.  In the absence of a stronger guarantee by the
 * implementation, undefined behavior may result from the invocation
 * of any method on a collection that is being mutated by another
 * thread; this includes direct invocations, passing the collection to
 * a method that might perform invocations, and using an existing
 * iterator to examine the collection.
 *
 * <p>Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined in
 * terms of the {@link Object#equals(Object) equals} method.  For example,
 * the specification for the {@link #contains(Object) contains(Object o)}
 * method says: "returns <tt>true</tt> if and only if this collection
 * contains at least one element <tt>e</tt> such that
 * <tt>(o==null ? e==null : o.equals(e))</tt>."  This specification should
 * <i>not</i> be construed to imply that invoking <tt>Collection.contains</tt>
 * with a non-null argument <tt>o</tt> will cause <tt>o.equals(e)</tt> to be
 * invoked for any element <tt>e</tt>.  Implementations are free to implement
 * optimizations whereby the <tt>equals</tt> invocation is avoided, for
 * example, by first comparing the hash codes of the two elements.  (The
 * {@link Object#hashCode()} specification guarantees that two objects with
 * unequal hash codes cannot be equal.)  More generally, implementations of
 * the various Collections Framework interfaces are free to take advantage of
 * the specified behavior of underlying {@link Object} methods wherever the
 * implementor deems it appropriate.
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
