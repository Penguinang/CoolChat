 * is created, an internal buffer array is
 * created. As bytes  from the stream are read
 * or skipped, the internal buffer is refilled
 * as necessary  from the contained input stream,
 * many bytes at a time. The <code>mark</code>
 * operation  remembers a point in the input
 * stream and the <code>reset</code> operation
 * causes all the  bytes read since the most
 * recent <code>mark</code> operation to be
 * reread before new bytes are  taken from
