	 * their environment.
	 *
	 * <p>The returned object may be modified using ordinary {@link
	 * java.util.Map Map} operations.  These modifications will be
	 * visible to subprocesses started via the {@link #start()}
	 * method.  Two {@code ProcessBuilder} instances always
	 * contain independent process environments, so changes to the
	 * returned map will never be reflected in any other
	 * {@code ProcessBuilder} instance or the values returned by
	 * {@link System#getenv System.getenv}.
	 *
	 * <p>If the system does not support environment variables, an
	 * empty map is returned.
	 *
	 * <p>The returned map does not permit null keys or values.
	 * Attempting to insert or query the presence of a null key or
	 * value will throw a {@link NullPointerException}.
	 * Attempting to query the presence of a key or value which is not
	 * of type {@link String} will throw a {@link ClassCastException}.
	 *
	 * <p>The behavior of the returned map is system-dependent.  A
	 * system may not allow modifications to environment variables or
	 * may forbid certain variable names or values.  For this reason,
	 * attempts to modify the map may fail with
	 * {@link UnsupportedOperationException} or
	 * {@link IllegalArgumentException}
	 * if the modification is not permitted by the operating system.
	 *
	 * <p>Since the external format of environment variable names and
	 * values is system-dependent, there may not be a one-to-one
	 * mapping between them and Java's Unicode strings.  Nevertheless,
	 * the map is implemented in such a way that environment variables
	 * which are not modified by Java code will have an unmodified
	 * native representation in the subprocess.
	 *
	 * <p>The returned map and its collection views may not obey the
	 * general contract of the {@link Object#equals} and
	 * {@link Object#hashCode} methods.
	 *
	 * <p>The returned map is typically case-sensitive on all platforms.
	 *
	 * <p>If a security manager exists, its
	 * {@link SecurityManager#checkPermission checkPermission} method
	 * is called with a
	 * {@link RuntimePermission}{@code ("getenv.*")} permission.
	 * This may result in a {@link SecurityException} being thrown.
