/**
 * This class represents an Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address.
 * Defined by <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc790.txt">
 * <i>RFC&nbsp;790: Assigned Numbers</i></a>,
 * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt">
 * <i>RFC&nbsp;1918: Address Allocation for Private Internets</i></a>,
 * and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2365.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2365:
 * Administratively Scoped IP Multicast</i></a>
 *
 * <h4> <A NAME="format">Textual representation of IP addresses</a> </h4>
 *
 * Textual representation of IPv4 address used as input to methods
 * takes one of the following forms:
 *
 * <blockquote><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 summary="layout">
 * <tr><td><tt>d.d.d.d</tt></td></tr>
 * <tr><td><tt>d.d.d</tt></td></tr>
 * <tr><td><tt>d.d</tt></td></tr>
 * <tr><td><tt>d</tt></td></tr>
 * </table></blockquote>
 *
 * <p> When four parts are specified, each is interpreted as a byte of
 * data and assigned, from left to right, to the four bytes of an IPv4
 * address.

 * <p> When a three part address is specified, the last part is
 * interpreted as a 16-bit quantity and placed in the right most two
 * bytes of the network address. This makes the three part address
 * format convenient for specifying Class B net- work addresses as
 * 128.net.host.
 *
 * <p> When a two part address is supplied, the last part is
 * interpreted as a 24-bit quantity and placed in the right most three
 * bytes of the network address. This makes the two part address
 * format convenient for specifying Class A network addresses as
 * net.host.
 *
 * <p> When only one part is given, the value is stored directly in
 * the network address without any byte rearrangement.
 *
 * <p> For methods that return a textual representation as output
 * value, the first form, i.e. a dotted-quad string, is used.
 *
 * <h4> The Scope of a Multicast Address </h4>
 * 
 * Historically the IPv4 TTL field in the IP header has doubled as a
 * multicast scope field: a TTL of 0 means node-local, 1 means
 * link-local, up through 32 means site-local, up through 64 means
 * region-local, up through 128 means continent-local, and up through
 * 255 are global. However, the administrative scoping is preferred.
 * Please refer to <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2365.txt">
 * <i>RFC&nbsp;2365: Administratively Scoped IP Multicast</i></a>
 * @since 1.4
