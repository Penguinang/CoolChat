 * A piped output stream can be connected to a piped input stream 
 * to create a communications pipe. The piped output stream is the 
 * sending end of the pipe. Typically, data is written to a 
 * <code>PipedOutputStream</code> object by one thread and data is 
 * read from the connected <code>PipedInputStream</code> by some 
 * other thread. Attempting to use both objects from a single thread 
 * is not recommended as it may deadlock the thread.
 * The pipe is said to be <a name=BROKEN> <i>broken</i> </a> if a
 * thread that was reading data bytes from the connected piped input 
 * stream is no longer alive.
