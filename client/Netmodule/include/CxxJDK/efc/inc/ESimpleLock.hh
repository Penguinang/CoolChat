	 *
	 * <p>The ability to interrupt a lock acquisition in some
	 * implementations may not be possible, and if possible may be an
	 * expensive operation.  The programmer should be aware that this
	 * may be the case. An implementation should document when this is
	 * the case.
	 *
	 * <p>An implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over
	 * normal method return.
	 *
	 * <p>A {@code Lock} implementation may be able to detect
	 * erroneous use of the lock, such as an invocation that would
	 * cause deadlock, and may throw an (unchecked) exception in such
	 * circumstances.  The circumstances and the exception type must
	 * be documented by that {@code Lock} implementation.
	 *
	 * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is
	 *         interrupted while acquiring the lock (and interruption
	 *         of lock acquisition is supported).
