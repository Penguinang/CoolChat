     * <p>Notes:
     * <p> For Internet Protocol v4 the value consists of an octet
     * with precedence and TOS fields as detailed in RFC 1349. The
     * TOS field is bitset created by bitwise-or'ing values such
     * the following :-
     * <p>
     * <UL>
     * <LI><CODE>IPTOS_LOWCOST (0x02)</CODE></LI>

     * <LI><CODE>IPTOS_LOWDELAY (0x10)</CODE></LI>
     * </UL>
     * The last low order bit is always ignored as this
     * corresponds to the MBZ (must be zero) bit.
     * <p>
     * Setting bits in the precedence field may result in a
     * SocketException indicating that the operation is not
     * permitted.
     * <p>
     * As RFC 1122 section 4.2.4.2 indicates, a compliant TCP
     * implementation should, but is not required to, let application
     * change the TOS field during the lifetime of a connection.
     * So whether the type-of-service field can be changed after the
     * TCP connection has been established depends on the implementation
     * in the underlying platform. Applications should not assume that
     * they can change the TOS field after the connection.
     * <p>
