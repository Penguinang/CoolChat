/**
 * The multicast datagram socket class is useful for sending
 * and receiving IP multicast packets.  A MulticastSocket is
 * a (UDP) DatagramSocket, with additional capabilities for
 * joining "groups" of other multicast hosts on the internet.
 * <P>
 * A multicast group is specified by a class D IP address
 * and by a standard UDP port number. Class D IP addresses
 * are in the range <CODE>224.0.0.0</CODE> to <CODE>239.255.255.255</CODE>,
 * inclusive. The address 224.0.0.0 is reserved and should not be used.
 * <P>
 * One would join a multicast group by first creating a MulticastSocket
 * with the desired port, then invoking the
 * <CODE>joinGroup(InetAddress groupAddr)</CODE>
 * method:
 * <PRE>
 * // join a Multicast group and send the group salutations
 * ...
 * String msg = "Hello";
 * InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("228.5.6.7");
 * MulticastSocket s = new MulticastSocket(6789);
 * s.joinGroup(group);
 * DatagramPacket hi = new DatagramPacket(msg.getBytes(), msg.length(),
 *                             group, 6789);
 * s.send(hi);
 * // get their responses!
 * byte[] buf = new byte[1000];
 * DatagramPacket recv = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length);
 * s.receive(recv);
 * ...
 * // OK, I'm done talking - leave the group...
 * s.leaveGroup(group);
 * </PRE>
 *
 * When one sends a message to a multicast group, <B>all</B> subscribing
 * recipients to that host and port receive the message (within the
 * time-to-live range of the packet, see below).  The socket needn't
 * be a member of the multicast group to send messages to it.
 * <P>
 * When a socket subscribes to a multicast group/port, it receives
 * datagrams sent by other hosts to the group/port, as do all other
 * members of the group and port.  A socket relinquishes membership
 * in a group by the leaveGroup(InetAddress addr) method.  <B>
 * Multiple MulticastSocket's</B> may subscribe to a multicast group
 * and port concurrently, and they will all receive group datagrams.
 * <P>
 * Currently applets are not allowed to use multicast sockets.
 *
 * @since  JDK1.1
