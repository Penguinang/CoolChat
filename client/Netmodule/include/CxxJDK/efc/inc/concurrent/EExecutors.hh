 *        inaccessible.
 *   <li> Methods that create and return a {@link ThreadFactory}
 *        that sets newly created threads to a known state.
 *   <li> Methods that create and return a {@link Callable}
 *        out of other closure-like forms, so they can be used
 *        in execution methods requiring <tt>Callable</tt>.
