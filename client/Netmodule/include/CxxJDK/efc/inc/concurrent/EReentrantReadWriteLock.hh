/**
 * An implementation of {@link ReadWriteLock} supporting similar
 * semantics to {@link ReentrantLock}.
 * <p>This class has the following properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Acquisition order</b>
 *
 * <p> This class does not impose a reader or writer preference
 * ordering for lock access.  However, it does support an optional
 * <em>fairness</em> policy.
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b><i>Non-fair mode (default)</i></b>
 * <dd>When constructed as non-fair (the default), the order of entry
 * to the read and write lock is unspecified, subject to reentrancy
 * constraints.  A nonfair lock that is continously contended may
 * indefinitely postpone one or more reader or writer threads, but
 * will normally have higher throughput than a fair lock.
 * <p>
 *
 * <dt><b><i>Fair mode</i></b>
 * <dd> When constructed as fair, threads contend for entry using an
 * approximately arrival-order policy. When the currently held lock
 * is released either the longest-waiting single writer thread will
 * be assigned the write lock, or if there is a group of reader threads
 * waiting longer than all waiting writer threads, that group will be
 * assigned the read lock.
 *
 * <p>A thread that tries to acquire a fair read lock (non-reentrantly)
 * will block if either the write lock is held, or there is a waiting
 * writer thread. The thread will not acquire the read lock until
 * after the oldest currently waiting writer thread has acquired and
 * released the write lock. Of course, if a waiting writer abandons
 * its wait, leaving one or more reader threads as the longest waiters
 * in the queue with the write lock free, then those readers will be
 * assigned the read lock.
 *
 * <p>A thread that tries to acquire a fair write lock (non-reentrantly)
 * will block unless both the read lock and write lock are free (which
 * implies there are no waiting threads).  (Note that the non-blocking
 * {@link ReadLock#tryLock()} and {@link WriteLock#tryLock()} methods
 * do not honor this fair setting and will acquire the lock if it is
 * possible, regardless of waiting threads.)
 * <p>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <li><b>Reentrancy</b>
 *
 * <p>This lock allows both readers and writers to reacquire read or
 * write locks in the style of a {@link ReentrantLock}. Non-reentrant
 * readers are not allowed until all write locks held by the writing
 * thread have been released.
 *
 * <p>Additionally, a writer can acquire the read lock, but not
 * vice-versa.  Among other applications, reentrancy can be useful
 * when write locks are held during calls or callbacks to methods that
 * perform reads under read locks.  If a reader tries to acquire the
 * write lock it will never succeed.
 *
 * <li><b>Lock downgrading</b>
 * <p>Reentrancy also allows downgrading from the write lock to a read lock,
 * by acquiring the write lock, then the read lock and then releasing the
 * write lock. However, upgrading from a read lock to the write lock is
 * <b>not</b> possible.
 *
 * <li><b>Interruption of lock acquisition</b>
 * <p>The read lock and write lock both support interruption during lock
 * acquisition.
 *
 * <li><b>{@link Condition} support</b>
 * <p>The write lock provides a {@link Condition} implementation that
 * behaves in the same way, with respect to the write lock, as the
 * {@link Condition} implementation provided by
 * {@link ReentrantLock#newCondition} does for {@link ReentrantLock}.
 * This {@link Condition} can, of course, only be used with the write lock.
 *
 * <p>The read lock does not support a {@link Condition} and
 * {@code readLock().newCondition()} throws
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
 *
 * <li><b>Instrumentation</b>
 * <p>This class supports methods to determine whether locks
 * are held or contended. These methods are designed for monitoring
 * system state, not for synchronization control.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample usages</b>. Here is a code sketch showing how to exploit
 * reentrancy to perform lock downgrading after updating a cache (exception
 * handling is elided for simplicity):
 * <pre>
 * class CachedData {
 *   Object data;
 *   volatile boolean cacheValid;
 *   ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *
 *   void processCachedData() {
 *     rwl.readLock().lock();
 *     if (!cacheValid) {
 *        // Must release read lock before acquiring write lock
 *        rwl.readLock().unlock();
 *        rwl.writeLock().lock();
 *        // Recheck state because another thread might have acquired
 *        //   write lock and changed state before we did.
 *        if (!cacheValid) {
 *          data = ...
 *          cacheValid = true;
 *        }
 *        // Downgrade by acquiring read lock before releasing write lock
 *        rwl.readLock().lock();
 *        rwl.writeLock().unlock(); // Unlock write, still hold read
 *     }
 *
 *     use(data);
 *     rwl.readLock().unlock();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * ReentrantReadWriteLocks can be used to improve concurrency in some
 * uses of some kinds of Collections. This is typically worthwhile
 * only when the collections are expected to be large, accessed by
 * more reader threads than writer threads, and entail operations with
 * overhead that outweighs synchronization overhead. For example, here
 * is a class using a TreeMap that is expected to be large and
 * concurrently accessed.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * class RWDictionary {
 *    private final Map<String, Data> m = new TreeMap<String, Data>();
 *    private final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *    private final Lock r = rwl.readLock();
 *    private final Lock w = rwl.writeLock();
 *
 *    public Data get(String key) {
 *        r.lock();
 *        try { return m.get(key); }
 *        finally { r.unlock(); }
 *    }
 *    public String[] allKeys() {
 *        r.lock();
 *        try { return m.keySet().toArray(); }
 *        finally { r.unlock(); }
 *    }
 *    public Data put(String key, Data value) {
 *        w.lock();
 *        try { return m.put(key, value); }
 *        finally { w.unlock(); }
 *    }
 *    public void clear() {
 *        w.lock();
 *        try { m.clear(); }
 *        finally { w.unlock(); }
 *    }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
 *
 * <p>This lock supports a maximum of 65535 recursive write locks
 * and 65535 read locks. Attempts to exceed these limits result in
 * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.
