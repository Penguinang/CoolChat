/**
   The NDC class implements <i>nested diagnostic contexts</i> as
   defined by Neil Harrison in the article "Patterns for Logging
   Diagnostic Messages" part of the book "<i>Pattern Languages of
   Program Design 3</i>" edited by Martin et al.

   <p>A Nested Diagnostic Context, or NDC in short, is an instrument
   to distinguish interleaved log output from different sources. Log
   output is typically interleaved when a server handles multiple
   clients near-simultaneously.

   <p>Interleaved log output can still be meaningful if each log entry
   from different contexts had a distinctive stamp. This is where NDCs
   come into play.

   <p><em><b>Note that NDCs are managed on a per thread
   basis</b></em>. NDC operations such as {@link #push push}, {@link
   #pop}, {@link #clear}, {@link #getDepth} and {@link #setMaxDepth}
   affect the NDC of the <em>current</em> thread only. NDCs of other
   threads remain unaffected.

   <p>For example, a servlet can build a per client request NDC
   consisting the clients host name and other information contained in
   the the request. <em>Cookies</em> are another source of distinctive
   information. To build an NDC one uses the {@link #push push}
   operation. Simply put,

   <p><ul>
     <li>Contexts can be nested.

     <p><li>When entering a context, call <code>NDC.push</code>. As a
     side effect, if there is no nested diagnostic context for the
     current thread, this method will create it.

     <p><li>When leaving a context, call <code>NDC.pop</code>.

     <p><li><b>When exiting a thread make sure to call {@link #remove
     NDC.remove()}</b>.
   </ul>

   <p>There is no penalty for forgetting to match each
   <code>push</code> operation with a corresponding <code>pop</code>,
   except the obvious mismatch between the real application context
   and the context set in the NDC.

   <p>If configured to do so, {@link PatternLayout} and {@link
   TTCCLayout} instances automatically retrieve the nested diagnostic
   context for the current thread without any user intervention.
   Hence, even if a servlet is serving multiple clients
   simultaneously, the logs emanating from the same code (belonging to
   the same category) can still be distinguished because each client
   request will have a different NDC tag.

   <p>Heavy duty systems should call the {@link #remove} method when
   leaving the run method of a thread. This ensures that the memory
   used by the thread can be freed by the Java garbage
   collector. There is a mechanism to lazily remove references to dead
   threads. In practice, this means that you can be a little sloppy
   and sometimes forget to call {@link #remove} before exiting a
   thread.

   <p>A thread may inherit the nested diagnostic context of another
   (possibly parent) thread using the {@link #inherit inherit}
   method. A thread may obtain a copy of its NDC with the {@link
   #cloneStack cloneStack} method and pass the reference to any other
   thread, in particular to a child.
